    <p style="text-align:justify;">The icons used for Pagini were not created by me, but were downloaded from <a href="http://led24.de/iconset/">this website</a>. The owner has generously published 500 icons for free use, and it is only normal he should be acknowledged as their rightful owner and creator.</p>
    <p>It is also required that this text be not removed:</p>
    <code>You can do whatever you want with these icons (use on web or in desktop applications) as long as you don't pass them off as your own and remove this readme file. A credit statement and a link back to
http://led24.de/iconset/ or http://led24.de/ would be appreciated. Follow us on twitter http://twitter.com/gasyoun or email leds24@gmail.com
